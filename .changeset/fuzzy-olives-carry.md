'nextra': patch
---

- always cache md/mdx compiler for non-remote content and never cache for remote content

- refactor function arguments for `compileMdx`

- fix source code from loader was stripped starting from last match `export default MDXContent;` and
  until the end, so `transform` function was not applied

- fix `headings` were `undefined` in remote content
