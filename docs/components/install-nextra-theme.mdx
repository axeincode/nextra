import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

Add the following scripts in `package.json`:

```json filename="package.json"
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next",
  "build": "next build",
  "start": "next start"
},
```

You can start the server in development mode with the following command
according to your package manager:

```sh npm2yarn
npm run dev
```

or in production mode:

```sh npm2yarn
npm run build
npm run start
```

<Callout>
  If you're not familiar with Next.js, note that development mode is
  significantly slower since Next.js compiles every page you navigate to.
