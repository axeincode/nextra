# Organize Files

Nextra first collects all your Markdown files and configurations from the
`pages` directory, and then generates the “page map information” of your entire
site, to render things such as the _navigation bar_ and _sidebar_ below:

<br />

    generated automatically from Markdown files.

## Default Behavior

By default, the page map contains all `.md` and `.mdx` filenames and the
directory structure, sorted alphabetically. Then, Nextra will use the
[title](https://github.com/vercel/title) package to get formatted page names
from filenames.

For example if you have the following structure:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="pages" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="contact.md" />
    <FileTree.File name="index.mdx" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="about" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="legal.md" />
      <FileTree.File name="index.mdx" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

The resolved page map will be (note that all names were sorted alphabetically):

```json
[
  {
    "name": "About",
    "children": [{ "name": "Index" }, { "name": "Legal" }]
  },
  { "name": "Contact" },
  { "name": "Index" }
]
```

And the global page map will be imported to each page by Nextra. Then,
configured theme will render the actual UI with that page map.

## `_meta.js`

It's very common to customize each page's title, rather than just relying on
filenames. Having a page titled "Index" lacks clarity. It is preferable to
assign a meaningful title that accurately represents the content, such as
"Home".

That’s where `_meta.js` files comes in. You can have an `_meta.js` file in each
directory, and it will be used to override the default configuration of each
page:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="pages" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="_meta.js" />
    <FileTree.File name="contact.md" />
    <FileTree.File name="index.mdx" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="about" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="_meta.js" />
      <FileTree.File name="legal.md" />
      <FileTree.File name="index.mdx" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

<Callout>
  It's also possible to use the `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.tsx` extensions for `_meta`
  files (e.g. `_meta.ts`)
</Callout>

For example, you can put this in your `pages/_meta.js` file:

```js filename="pages/_meta.js"
export default {
  index: 'My Homepage',
  contact: 'Contact Us',
  about: 'About Us'
}
```

It tells Nextra the order of each page, and the correct title.

Alternatively, you can do it with `title` property and have other configurations
in there as well:

```js filename="pages/_meta.js"
export default {
  index: 'My Homepage',
  contact: 'Contact Us',
  about: {
    title: 'About Us'
    // ... extra configurations
  }
}
```

<Callout>
  You can use ESLint's built-in rule sort keys with a `/* eslint sort-keys:
  error */` comment to sort your sidebar items alphabetically.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  If you are using
  [next-sitemap](https://github.com/iamvishnusankar/next-sitemap), you will
  probably need to add `exclude: ['*/_meta']` to your `next-sitemap.config.js`
  file, as it is tricky to exclude `_meta` files from the build.
</Callout>

The extra configurations are passed to the **theme** as additional information.

<Cards>
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<NewsletterIcon />}
    title="Docs Theme"
