# Built-ins

import { WarningIcon } from '@components/icons'
import { Card, Cards } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

Nextra includes a couple of built-in components that you can use to better style
your documentation or blog:

<Cards>
  <Card
    icon={<WarningIcon />}
    title="Callout"
    href="/docs/guide/built-ins/callout"
  />
</Cards>
