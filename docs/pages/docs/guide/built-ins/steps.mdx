# Steps Component

A built-in component to turn a numbered list into a visual representation of
steps.

### This is the second step

### This is the third step

</Steps>

## Usage

Wrap a set of markdown h3 headings with the `Steps` component to turn them into
visual steps.

<Steps>

### Step 1

Content for step 1.

### Step 2

Contents for step 2.

</Steps>

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```mdx
import { Steps } from 'nextra/components'

<Steps>
### Step 1

Contents for step 1.

### Step 2

Contents for step 2.
</Steps>
```

### Excluding Headings from Table of Contents

To exclude the headings from the `<Steps>` component (or any other headings) to
appear in the Table of Contents, replace the Markdown headings `### ...` with
`<h3>` HTML element wrapped in curly braces.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```diff
<Steps>
- ### Step 1
+ {<h3>Step 1</h3>}

Contents for step 1.
</Steps>
```
