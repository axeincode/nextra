# Docs Theme

import { Callout, Tab, Tabs } from 'nextra-theme-docs'

Nextra Docs Theme is a theme that includes almost everything you need to build a modern documentation website. It includes a top navigation bar, a search bar, a pages sidebar, a TOC sidebar, and other built-in components.

## Quick Start from Template

{/* You can start by creating your own Nextra site and deploying to Vercel by clicking the link: */}

{/* [![Deploy to Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?demo-description=Markdown%20powered%20docs%20site.%20Built%20with%20Next.js.&demo-image=https%3A%2F%2Fnextra.vercel.app%2Fdemo.png&demo-title=Documentation%20Starter%20Kit&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fnextra.vercel.app%2F&project-name=nextjs-docs&repository-name=nextjs-docs&s=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fshuding%2Fnextra&from=templates) */}

{/* Vercel will fork the Nextra Docs template and deploy the site for you. Once done, every commit in the repository will be deployed automatically. */}

### Install

To create a Nextra Docs site manually, you have to install **Next.js**, **React**, **Nextra**, and **Nextra Docs Theme**. In your project directory, run the following command to install the dependencies:

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn']}>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    pnpm i next react react-dom nextra nextra-theme-docs
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npm i next react react-dom nextra nextra-theme-docs
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    yarn add next react react-dom nextra nextra-theme-docs
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Like any Next.js projects, you need to also add the following scripts to your `package.json` file:

```json filename="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start"
  }
}
```

<Callout>
  If you already have Next.js installed in your project, you only need to install `nextra` and `nextra-theme-docs` as the add-ons.
</Callout>

### Add Next.js Config

Create the following `next.config.js` file in your project’s root directory:

```js filename="next.config.js"
const withNextra = require('nextra')({
  theme: 'nextra-theme-docs',
  themeConfig: './theme.config.jsx',
})

module.exports = withNextra()

// If you have other Next.js configurations, you can pass them as the parameter:
// module.exports = withNextra({ /* other next.js config */ })
```

With the above configuration, Nextra can handle Markdown files in your Next.js project, with the specified theme. Full Nextra configurations can be found here:

import { Card, Cards } from '@components/card'

import switchIcon from '@components/icons/switch'

<Cards>
  <Card icon={switchIcon} title="Configure Nextra" href="/docs/docs-theme/theme-configuration"/>
</Cards>

### Create Docs Theme Config

Lastly, create the corresponding `theme.config.jsx` file in your project’s root directory. This will be used to configure the Nextra Docs theme:

```jsx filename="theme.config.jsx"
export default {
  logo: <span>My Nextra Documentation</span>,
  // ...
}
```

More options for this theme can be found here:

<Cards>
  <Card icon={switchIcon} title="Configure Docs Theme" href="/docs/docs-theme/theme-configuration"/>
</Cards>

### Ready to Go!

Now, you can create your first MDX page in `pages/index.mdx`:

```mdx filename="pages/index.mdx"
# Welcome to Nextra

Hello, world!
```

And run the `dev` command to start developing the project:

```bash
pnpm dev
```
